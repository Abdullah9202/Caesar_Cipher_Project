# Caesar Cipher

This repository contains Python scripts for a simple Caesar Cipher implementation.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This implementation allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using a specified shift amount.

## Files

1. **source.py**: Python script containing the main program logic for interacting with users and performing encryption/decryption.

2. **my_Func.py**: Python script containing functions for performing the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption operations.

## Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher program, run the `source.py` script. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify the text, shift amount, and whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message.

## Features

- Encryption and decryption of messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Support for handling non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, symbols, spaces) in the input text.
- Clear and informative user interface.
- Modular design with separate functions for encryption/decryption operations.
